# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning Playground üöÄ

Welcome to the GPT-2 Fine-Tuning Playground\! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that explore the architecture of GPT-2 and demonstrate how to adapt its behavior for specific tasks, from changing its writing style to imitating a character's persona.

This project is a hands-on journey into the world of transfer learning for language models using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## notebooks Overview ‚ú®

This repository is structured as a series of projects, each building on the last.

  * üî¨ [GPT_2_structure_analysis.ipynb](./GPT_2_structure_analysis.ipynb)

      * A deep dive into the architecture of the base GPT-2 model. This notebook explores its layers, parameters, and the fundamental components of a transformer-based language model.

  * üì∞ [GPT_2_fine_tuning_news.ipynb](./GPT_2_fine_tuning_news.ipynb)

      * **Project Act 1: Style Adaptation.** This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2 on a news dataset. The goal is to shift the model's default style to a more formal, journalistic tone.

  * üÉè [GPT_2_fine_tuning_joker.ipynb](./GPT_2_fine_tuning_joker.ipynb)

      * **Project Act 2: Persona Imitation.** A more advanced experiment in stylistic transfer. This notebook fine-tunes GPT-2 on a custom dataset to mimic the chaotic and unpredictable speaking style of the Joker, exploring the challenges and limitations of the process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts & Technologies

This project covers several key concepts in modern NLP:

  * **Model Architecture:** Understanding the inner workings of GPT-2.
  * **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting a pre-trained model on a custom dataset.
  * **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):** Using LoRA to fine-tune models efficiently.
  * **Prompt Engineering:** Guiding a fine-tuned model to produce desired outputs.
  * **Libraries:** `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `PEFT`, and `Datasets`.
